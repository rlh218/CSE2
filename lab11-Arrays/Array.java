//lab11 Array Java Program
        //Purpose of this program is to: 
            /**Write a program that performs the following tasks:
                    1) Create two integer arrays (array1 and array2) of size 50.
                    2) Fill array1 with random integers between 0 and 100
                    3) Use linear search to print out the minimum and maximum values of array1.
                    4) Add increasing random numbers to array2. (The first number should be between 0 and 100).
                    5) Print out the minimum and maximum values of array2.
                    6) Prompt the user to enter an int >= 0, and exit the program if they do not enter an int >= 0.
                    7) Use binary search to search the array for the inputted value.
                    8) Say if the number was found or not found.
                    9) If the number was not found, print out the numbers below and above the searched for number.*/
